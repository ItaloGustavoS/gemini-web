 Move gradually the apron feeder in the conveying direction. In order to avoid damages of the carrying frame,
the chain segments should run in the lower run over a beam (e.g., wooden beam) positioned at the take-up
tumbler and be carefully pulled out by means of a hoisting gear.
CAUTION, SUSPENDED LOADS!
Persons are not permitted to stay or work under suspended loads. Every movement
must be continuously monitored by several persons. The operator and monitoring
personnel must always remain in contact.
DANGER
 Dismount step-by-step the aprons with return rollers from the lower chain strand (lower run) and fasten them
on the new chain strand in the upper run.
 After the end position of the new chain strands has been reached, detach the old chain segments from the
new ones at the chain lock.
 Bring the both chain strands in the upper and lower run together at the reversal point of the chain at the take-
up tumbler using rope hoists and connect them with each other in the chain lock.
 After the new chain strands have been installed, it is possible to mount aprons (128 kg and 147 kg).
 Re-install protective guard of the take-up tumbler.
 Loosen the screwed connection between the bearing block of the take-up tumbler and the carrying frame.
 Tension the chain (see Chapter 1.5.4).
When the conveyor moves, no persons shall be present on or in the apron feeder.
Note the higher risk of injuries.

1.5.4 Setting Chain Pre-tension
For information regarding chain tensioning refer to drawing no. 09136447.
NOTE
For documentation of the tensioning device see Manual 7, Register 7.1.3.
NOTE
Prior to repair work, run the Semi mobile crushing station empty and put it out of
operation.
Block the apron feeder, the adjacent spillage conveyor and the impact crusher in a
way preventing the machine from any undesired movements.
DANGER
The tension of the apron chains can be adjusted by the take-up sprocket wheels
stepwise.
This tension adjustment is effected by hydraulic cylinders.
The maximum admissible tension force on each side is 100 kN.
IMPORTANT
 Arrange the hydraulic cylinders in level of the bearing axis as shown in the drawing and pre-stress them
slightly.

Project no.: 109794 Page: 20 of 62 File name: 109794_M6_CS_EN.docx
 Loosen the fastening bolts between take-up sprocket wheels and carrying frame (do not remove the
fastening bolts).
 Before loosening the fastening bolts make sure that the tensioning cylinders provide sufficient initial tension
in order to avoid jamming of the fastening bolts.
 Re-adjust as well the fastening bolts between take-up sprocket wheels and carrying frame.
 Shift the take-up sprocket wheel until the desired position is reached. Make sure that the take-up sprocket is
shifted evenly and simultaneously on both sides in order to avoid jamming and tripping from the guide
arrangement.
 Add or remove shim plates and secure them by means of holding clamps.
 Bolt together take-up sprocket wheels and supporting frame.
 Remove the hydraulic cylinders.
 Perform test operation of the apron feeder without conveyed material.

1.5.5 Relieving the Chain from Tension
For documentation of the tensioning device see Manual 7, Register 7.1.3.
NOTE
Prior to repair work, run the Semi mobile crushing station empty and put it out of
operation.
Block the apron feeder, the adjacent spillage conveyor and the impact crusher in a
way preventing the machine from any undesired movements.
DANGER
The chain can be relieved from tension by means of two hydraulic cylinders as follows:
 Position the tensioning cylinders in level of the bearing axis.
 Pre-stress slightly the tensioning cylinders.
 Loosen the fastening bolts between bearing block and carrying frame (do not take remove the screws).
 Before loosening the fastening bolts make sure that the tensioning cylinders provide sufficient initial tension
in order to avoid jamming of the fastening bolts.
 If necessary, adjust the fastening screws between bearing block and carrying frame.
 Remove the shim plates.
 In order to fix the take-up tumbler tighten again the fastening screws between bearing block and carrying
frame.
 Relieve the tensioning cylinders from tension and remove them.

1.5.6 Replacement of Gear Rim Segments
Prior to repair work, run the Semi mobile crushing station empty and put it out of
operation.
Block the apron feeder, the adjacent spillage conveyor and the impact crusher in a
way preventing the machine from any undesired movements.
DANGER
Replacement of gear rim segments is performed at the take-up tumbler or at the
driven tumbler.
NOTE
 Remove protective gratings (on the left and right side)
 If necessary, remove protective hood of the take-up tumbler, note the protective hood weight (180 kg).
 Move the gear rim segment to be replaced so that it is not in engagement with the chain.
Gear rim segment
 Isolate the drive unit of apron feeder from power supply and secure it against unintended start-up.
WARNING, DANGER OF SQUEEZING INJURIES
Work may only be started after power cutoff. Otherwise there is a danger of
squeezing-off limbs.
WARNING
 Sling the apron strands to a hoisting gear and secure against movement.
 Undo the bolted connections between the gear rim segment and sprocket wheel.
Project: Stanari Revision: 0
Project no.: 109794 Page: 23 of 62 File name: 109794_M6_CS_EN.docx
 Pull out the gear rim segment (approx. 11 kg) to the side and put it safely down.
CAUTION, SUSPENDED LOADS!
Persons are not permitted to stay or work under suspended loads. Every movement
must be continuously monitored by several persons. The operator and monitoring
personnel must always remain in contact.
DANGER
 Re-assembly of the components is performed in the reversed order under observance of following
instructions:
 Ream the new gear rim segment in installed condition together with the chain wheel bore to Ø21 H7
(see sketch).
New screw connections must be used for the reassembly of the tooth segments!
Tighten the fixing bolts M20x65 of the tooth segments with the prescribed torque
of 165 Nm and lock the nuts by locknuts!

1.5.7 Removal of Take-up Tumbler Shaft
Prior to repair work, run the Semi mobile crushing station empty and put it out of
operation.
Block the apron feeder, the adjacent spillage conveyor and the impact crusher in a
way preventing the machine from any undesired movements.
DANGER
Undo the fastening screws
of pedestal bearings
Protective
guard
 Remove protective guard taking into consideration the weight of the protective guard (180 kg).
 Move the apron feeder as far as one of the two aprons with the chain lock is positioned at the reversal point
of the chain at the take-up sprocket.
 Isolate the drive unit from power supply and secure it against unintended start-up.
WARNING, DANGER OF SQUEEZING INJURIES
Work may only be started after power cutoff. Otherwise there is a danger of
squeezing-off limbs.
WARNING

Project no.: 109794 Page: 25 of 62 File name: 109794_M6_CS_EN.docx
 Completely relieve the chain from tension (see Chapter 1.5.5).
 Sling the apron above the chain locks to a hoisting gear (approx. weight 128 kg).
 Use a hoisting gear to secure the lower chain strands in the area of chain locks to be opened against falling
down
WARNING, DANGER OF SQUEEZING INJURIES
Utmost care is required when suspending or threading-in auxiliary tools for lifting
of loads (chains, lifting belts, ropes). Note the risk of squeezing-off limbs.
WARNING
 Open the chain locks by unscrewing the apron bolt connections, remove the apron.
 Put the lower chain strands (lower run) down on the ground.
 Use a hoisting gear to lift the upper chain strands (upper run) from the wheel sprockets and secure them
against moving.
 Secure the take-up shaft with sprocket wheels including gear rims (total mass approx. 1095 kg) by means of
a hoisting gear.
 Loosen fastening screws of pedestal bearings and use a hoisting gear to lift out and lower the take-up shaft.
CAUTION, SUSPENDED LOADS!
Persons are not permitted to stay or work under suspended loads. Every movement
must be continuously monitored by several persons. The operator and monitoring
personnel must always remain in contact.
DANGER
 Bring the components to the repair site.
 Re-assembly is performed in the reversed order under observance of following instructions:
 Note the tightening torque of the pedestal bearing bolts
 Re-installation of the aprons.
 Tension the chain (see Chapter 1.5.4)
