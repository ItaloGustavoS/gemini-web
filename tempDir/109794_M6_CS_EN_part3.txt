 Remove all cable connections from the drive unit.
 Use lifting eyes for suspension of the drive unit to the hoist gear and secure it against tilting over. When
choosing the hoisting and slinging equipment, take account of the drive unit weight (approx. 2780 kg)!
 Loosen the locking screws of the shrink disc evenly and one after the other.
 Undo the fasteners of the torque support.
 Use a pulling device to carefully pull off the drive unit. If the locking collar does not come away from the inner
ring automatically, it is possible to undo a few locking screws and screw them into the adjacent forcing
threads.
 Pull the shrink disc off the hub, observing the following:
 Any rust that may have formed between the hub and the end of the shaft must be removed beforehand.
 Lift the drive unit and put it safely down on the ground.
CAUTION, SUSPENDED LOADS!
Persons are not permitted to stay or work under suspended loads. Every movement
must be continuously monitored by several persons. The operator and monitoring
personnel must always remain in contact.
DANGER
 Bring the components to the repair site for further disassembly.
 Re-assemble the unit in reversed order under observance of following instructions:
 Degrease the hub and the shaft. The outside surface of the hub can only be greased in the area of the
shrink disc seat.
 Check the correct position of the shrink disc. The shrink disc is positioned correctly when it is in contact
with the shaft shoulder.
 Push carefully the drive unit at the hub onto the shaft. Perform the mounting operation slowly to allow
the compressed air to escape around the outside of the shaft.
 Tighten all locking screws at evenly spaced intervals until the front lateral surfaces of the locking collar
and inner ring are in alignment.
 Note the tightening torques.

For further information regarding assembly/disassembly of the drive unit please
refer to the manufacturer documentation (see Assembly and Operating
Instructions for the drive unit PHF072 KF157 DRE280S4).
For the bolt securing of the torque support a new split pin must be used! After
reassembly the split pin ends must be bent open.
IMPORTANT
 Restore all electrical connections.
 Test operation of the equipment without conveyed material.
After reassembly inspect the gear unit oil level in accordance with the lubrication
schedule. Add oil if needed.

1.5.2 Replacement of Drive Shaft with Drive Sprockets
Prior to repair work, run the Semi mobile crushing station empty and put it out of
operation.
Block the apron feeder, the adjacent spillage conveyor and the impact crusher in a
way preventing the machine from any undesired movements.
DANGER
 Advance the chain in a way that the chain locks to be opened are positioned above the drive sprockets.
Driven sprocket wheel
Drive shaft
Chain lock
 Isolate the drive unit of apron feeder from power supply and secure it against unintended start-up.
WARNING, DANGER OF SQUEEZING INJURIES
Work may only be started after power cutoff. Otherwise there is a danger of
squeezing-off limbs.
WARNING
 Remove safety guards and attachment parts.
 Remove discharge hood and discharge box.
 Dismount the drive unit (see Chapter 1.5.1).
 Relieve the chain from tension (see Chapter 1.5.5).
 Sling the apron over the chain locks to a hoisting gear (approx. weight 128 kg) and secure against
movement.
 Use a hoisting gear to secure the lower chain strands in the area of chain locks to be opened against falling
down

WARNING, DANGER OF SQUEEZING INJURIES
Utmost care is required when suspending or threading-in auxiliary tools for lifting
of loads (chains, lifting belts, ropes). Note the risk of squeezing-off limbs.
WARNING
 Open the chain locks by taking out the apron bolts and remove the apron.
CAUTION, SUSPENDED LOADS!
Persons are not permitted to stay or work under suspended loads. Every movement
must be continuously monitored by several persons. The operator and monitoring
personnel must always remain in contact.
DANGER
 Let down the lower chain strands and fix them in their position.
 Use a hoisting gear to lift carefully the upper chain strands and fix them in their position.
 Secure the driving shaft (approx. weight 1734 kg) by means of a hoisting gear.
WARNING, DANGER OF SQUEEZING INJURIES
Utmost care is required when suspending or threading-in auxiliary tools for lifting
of loads (chains, lifting belts, ropes). Note the risk of squeezing-off limbs.
WARNING
 Unscrew the bearing bolts and lift out the drive shaft by means of a hoisting gear.
CAUTION, SUSPENDED LOADS!
Persons are not permitted to stay or work under suspended loads. Every movement
must be continuously monitored by several persons. The operator and monitoring
personnel must always remain in contact.
DANGER
 Bring the components to the repair site for further disassembly.
 Pull off the bearing with auxiliary device.
 Dismount the drive sprockets by loosening the taper key.
 Re-assembly of the components is performed in the reversed order under observance of following
instructions:
 Note the tightening torque of the bearing bolts M36 =2100 Nm
 Re-installation of the aprons.
 Tension the chain (see Chapter 1.5.4).

1.5.3 Replacement of Chain Strands
For documentation of the chain strands see Manual 7, Register 7.1.2.
NOTE
Prior to repair work, run the Semi mobile crushing station empty and put it out of
operation.
Block the apron feeder, the adjacent spillage conveyor and the impact crusher in a
way preventing the machine from any undesired movements.
DANGER
Each of the two chains of the apron feeder consists of two chain segments which
are linked by chain locks. The following instruction describes the procedure of
replacing two of the chain segments running side by side.
NOTE

WARNING, DANGER OF SQUEEZING INJURIES
Opening and closing of the chain must be performed by an authorized specialist
company.
WARNING
 Relieve the chain from tension (see Chapter 1.5.5).
Prior to chain opening, it is necessary to fix the take-up tumbler in its position. For
this purpose, tighten again the fastening screws between the bearing block of the
