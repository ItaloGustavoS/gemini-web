 The rear part of housing must be removed before the impact rockers can be taken out:
 Remove the hexagon head bolts M 30 (46 mm across flats) from the flanges.
 Sling the rear part of housing (weight approx. 10600 kg) to a suitable hoisting gear.
WARNING, DANGER OF SQUEEZING INJURIES
Utmost care is required when suspending or threading-in auxiliary tools for lifting
of loads (chains, lifting belts, ropes). Note the risk of squeezing-off limbs.
WARNING
 Remove the pin from the zone of pivot point of rear part, Ø120x450, followed by removal of the rear part
of housing.
CAUTION, SUSPENDED LOADS!
Persons are not permitted to stay or work under suspended loads. Every movement
must be continuously monitored by several persons. The operator and monitoring
personnel must always remain in contact.
DANGER
 Remove the pin of the respective adjusting device, Ø100x620.
Note that the impact rockers must be laterally jammed beforehand to avoid
oscillation.
IMPORTANT
 Sling the rocker (weight of upper rocker: 8258 kg; weight of lower rocker: 5840 kg) through the upper
inspection flaps to a suitable hoisting gear.

1.7.5 Replacement of Wear Plates
Prior to repair work, run the Semi mobile crushing station empty and put it out of
operation.
Block the impact crusher, the adjacent apron feeder and the spillage conveyor in a
way preventing the machine from any undesired movements.
DANGER
 Open the housing rear part (see Chapter 1.7.2)

 Use the rotor arresting bolt to secure the rotor (at the free shaft end)
 Undo the fastening screws between the wear plate and carrying frame

Undo fastening
screws
 When replacing the wear plates, note the following torques for tightening:
 Side wearing plates with hexagon head bolts M20 – torque for tightening 400 Nm
 Side wearing plates with hexagon head bolts M30 – torque for tightening 1450 Nm
 Side wearing plates with hexagon head bolts M36 – torque for tightening 2100 Nm
The housing wear plates installed in the area of crushing radius of the rotor are
subject to severe wear. Therefore, these wear plates must be checked more
frequently for tight fit and wear condition.
IMPORTANT
When re-installing, the hexagon head bolts must be inserted with a bolt securing
adhesive (e.g. Loctite).

1.7.6 Adjustment of Crushing Gap
1.7.6.1 Principles
Prior to repair work, run the Semi mobile crushing station empty and put it out of
operation.
Block the impact crusher, the adjacent apron feeder and the spillage conveyor in a
way preventing the machine from any undesired movements.
DANGER
Check the crushing result through regular analyses. Correct the gap width as
appropriate in order to compensate wear.
The final grain size distribution can be varied by operating the adjustment
spindles for correction of the gap existing between rotor and impact rockers.

1.7.6.2 Adjusting the crushing gap
The final grain size distribution can be varied by operating the adjustment spindles for correction of the gap
existing between rotor and impact rockers.
Coarse final grain size: Large crusher gap width
Fine final grain size: Small crusher gap width
NOTE
The following values have been pre-set by the manufacturer:
Crusher gap A: 250 mm
Crusher gap B: 150 mm
Adjustment procedures must be carried out evenly to ensure the parallelism of
impact rockers relative to the rotor axis!
IMPORTANT
Depending on the material to be crushed, the crusher gap pre-set by the
manufacturer may be required larger or smaller. The gap width actually required
should be determined on site.
NOTE
1.7.6.2.1 Increasing the gap
 With the machine at rest, evenly loosen the external adjustment nuts II on both adjustment spindles by one
turn in counterclockwise direction.
 After that, tighten both external adjustment nuts I of both adjustment spindles gradually and evenly up to one
turn in clockwise direction.
The thread of adjustment spindles has a pitch of 6 mm. One turn of adjustment nut
corresponds to a correction of the impact rocker by some 10 mm.
IMPORTANT
 Repeat this operation in parallel on both adjustment spindles until the desired crushing gap is obtained.

1.7.6.2.2 Decreasing the gap
 With the machine at rest, evenly loosen the external adjustment nuts II on both adjustment spindles by one
turn in counterclockwise direction.
 After that, loosen both external adjustment nuts I slowly and gradually up to one turn in counterclockwise
direction.
 The mass centre of gravity of impact rockers has been designed so that they may slew in by themselves.
The thread of adjustment spindles has a pitch of 6 mm. One turn of adjustment nut
corresponds to a correction of the impact rocker by some 10 mm.

 Repeat this operation in parallel on both adjustment spindles until the desired crushing gap is obtained.
1.7.6.2.3 Securing the new gap
 Once the desired gap width is reached in each single case, tighten the external adjustment nut I gradually
and evenly and lock it with the external adjustment nut II.
 Operate the rotor by „HAND“ and check if the blow bars are free, t.i., they do not collide with other parts.

1.7.7 Pre-tensioning and Re-tensioning of V-belts
For documentation of the V-belts see Manual 7, Register 7.3.2.
NOTE
Prior to repair work, run the Semi mobile crushing station empty and put it out of
operation.
Block the impact crusher, the adjacent apron feeder and the spillage conveyor in a
way preventing the machine from any undesired movements.
DANGER
 Use the rotor arresting bolt to secure the rotor (at the free shaft end).
 Undo the bolted connections between the tensioning frame and the sliding blocks of tensioning rails.

Project no.: 109794 Page: 60 of 62 File name: 109794_M6_CS_EN.docx
 The tensioning or relieving operation itself is made by means of the three outside tensioning spindles M48
(75 mm across flats). To avoid distortion of the tensioning frame, the tensioning spindles must be operated
evenly.
 Mark the measuring distance „M“ (1000 mm) on the free V-belt.
 Now tension the V-belts until the measuring distance „M“ of 1000 mm set during initial installation
increases to 1009 mm. In this case the drive is under the correct tension.
 If the drive must be re-tensioned, the V-belts must be relieved from tension again so that they can be
re-measured in a tension-free condition. Mark the measuring distance „M“ (1000 mm) on the free back
of V-belt. Now tension the V-belts until the measuring distance „M“ increases from 1000 mm to 1006
mm. Thus, the drive is re-tensioned correctly.
WARNING, DANGER OF SQUEEZING INJURIES
During displacement of drive station note that distances are changing. The risk of
bruising of limbs is present.
WARNING
 After the tensioning operation, be sure that the six fastening bolts of tensioning frame are retightened with a
torque of approx. 2100 Nm.
