of loads (chains, lifting belts, ropes). Note the risk of squeezing-off limbs.
WARNING
 Remove the cover cap of the shrink disc
 Loosen the locking screws of the shrink disc evenly and one after the other (see Operating Instructions for
the Gear Unit).
 Undo the fasteners of the torque support.
 Undo the screwed connections between the gear flange and geared motor
 Pull off carefully the geared motor and pull off the shrink disc (see Operating Instructions for the Gear Unit).
 Lift the drive unit and put it down on the ground.
CAUTION, SUSPENDED LOADS!
Persons are not permitted to stay or work under suspended loads. Every movement
must be continuously monitored by several persons. The operator and monitoring
personnel must always remain in contact.
DANGER
 Bring the components to the repair site for further disassembly.
 Re-assemble the unit in reversed order under observance of following instructions:
 The torque for tightening of tensioning bolts is 59 Nm.
During re-assembly of the geared unit note the installation instructions for the
shrink disc (see Assembly and Operating Instructions for the gear unit, chapter
4.7, type KHF107) and the cover cap of the shrink disc must be re-installed as well!

1.6.3 Taking out Chain Segment / Scraper
Prior to repair work, run the Semi mobile crushing station empty and put it out of
operation.
Block the spillage conveyor, the adjacent apron feeder and the impact crusher in a
way preventing the machine from any undesired movements.
DANGER
 Prior to disassembly, move the chain so that the chain segment to be replaced is positioned in the upper run.
 Switch off the drive unit and secure it against unintended start-up.

 Relieve the conveying chains from tension (see Chapter 1.6.6)
 Clamp the chains to the left and right of the segment to be replaced.
 Secure the scraper (weight approx. 33 kg) against falling down.
WARNING, DANGER OF SQUEEZING INJURIES
Utmost care is required when suspending or threading-in auxiliary tools for lifting
of loads (chains, lifting belts, ropes). Note the risk of squeezing-off limbs.
WARNING
 Remove fastening bolts on the chain locks.
 After that, the scraper to be replaced or the chain segment (the chain lock on the opposite end of the
segment to be replaced must also be opened) can be taken out.
 Re-assemble the unit in reversed order under observance of following instructions:
 Tensioning of chains after completion of all work (see Chapter 1.6.6).
