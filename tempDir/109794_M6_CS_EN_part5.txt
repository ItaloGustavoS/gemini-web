1.5.8 Replacement of Feeder Aprons
For information regarding apron replacing refer to drawing no. 09255162.
NOTE
Prior to repair work, run the Semi mobile crushing station empty and put it out of
operation.
Block the apron feeder, the adjacent spillage conveyor and the impact crusher in a
way preventing the machine from any undesired movements.
DANGER
Replacement of feeder aprons is possible only directly on the drive or take-up
tumbler in curved condition of the chain.
It is recommended to carry out replacement of aprons on the take-up tumbler to
avoid disassembly of the discharge box.
IMPORTANT When the discharge box is removed, replacement is also possible on the drive
tumbler.
 Move the apron feeder as far as the apron to be replaced is positioned at the vertex of the take-up sprocket.
 Isolate the drive unit from power supply and secure it against unintended start-up.
 Sling the apron to a hoisting gear (weight approx. 128 or 147 kg), undo the fastening bolts and take out the
apron.

CAUTION, SUSPENDED LOADS!
Persons are not permitted to stay or work under suspended loads. Every movement
must be continuously monitored by several persons. The operator and monitoring
personnel must always remain in contact.
DANGER
 Install the new apron as follows:
 Apply graphite lubricant to the bolt thread and to the lower side of head.
 Screw on the self-locking chain nuts so that the rounded edges are facing the chain member.
 Tighten the bolts (3/4"-16x99) with the specified torque of 320 40 Nm.
 Re-tighten each bolt with another half a turn.
Tightening torque of the aprons must be documented during assembly.

 Dismantle protective guards
 Remove aprons between two aprons with return rollers
 Move gradually the apron feeder as far as this assembly opening is positioned in the upper run above the
track roller to be replaced.
 Isolate the drive unit from power supply and secure it against unintended start-up.
WARNING, DANGER OF SQUEEZING INJURIES
Work may only be started after power cutoff. Otherwise there is a danger of
squeezing-off limbs.
WARNING
 Relieve the chain from tension (see Chapter 1.5.5).

 Sling the chain strand in the work area to a hoisting gear and lift it until the track roller is free.
WARNING, DANGER OF SQUEEZING INJURIES
Utmost care is required when suspending or threading-in auxiliary tools for lifting
of loads (chains, lifting belts, ropes). Note the risk of squeezing-off limbs.
WARNING
 Support the chain by means of suitable devices and secure it in its position.
 Loosen fastening screws of the track roller.
 Sling the track roller (approx. 51 kg) to a hoisting gear.
 Loosen fastening screws of the spacer plates.
 Lift the track roller to some 2-3 mm.
 Draw out the spacer plates.
 Use the hoisting gear to pull out the track roller and lower it to the ground.
CAUTION, SUSPENDED LOADS!
Persons are not permitted to stay or work under suspended loads. Every movement
must be continuously monitored by several persons. The operator and monitoring
personnel must always remain in contact.
DANGER
 Re-assembly is performed in the reversed order under observance of following instructions:
 Make sure to observe the torques for tightening of fixing parts.

1.6.1 Replacement of Drive Unit
For documentation of the geared motor see Manual 7, Register 7.2.
NOTE
POTENTIAL HAZARDS CAUSED BY ELECTRIC POWER
POTENTIAL RISK OF AUTOMATIC OR UNINTENDED START OF MACHINE
Only qualified electricians should carry out work on the power supply system.
DANGER Make sure that machine and plant equipment subject to compulsory inspections,
repair and maintenance work are isolated from power before such work is carried
out. To be sure, check the isolated equipment items if they are still under voltage.
Earth and short-circuit them and isolate other equipment in the vicinity from power
supply.
DANGER
Prior to all repair and erection work, the equipment and its components should be
isolated from power supply so that drives cannot be started by mistake while repair
work is carried out.
All cable connections of components to be replaced must be disconnected. After
reassembly, cable connections must be made again!
Prior to repair work, run the Semi mobile crushing station empty and put it out of
operation.
Block the spillage conveyor, the adjacent apron feeder and the impact crusher in a
way preventing the machine from any undesired movements.
