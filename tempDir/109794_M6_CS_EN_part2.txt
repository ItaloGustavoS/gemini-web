CAUTION, SUSPENDED LOADS!
Nominate only well-experienced persons for suspension of loads and for giving
instructions to the crane operator. The person giving instructions to the crane
operator must be positioned so that it is in sight contact with the crane operator or
may communicate with him through a radiotelephone set.
When replacement of single parts or larger components is required, the parts must
be safely fitted to the hoisting gear and handled so that all risks are excluded. Only
suitable hoisting gears and load carrying attachments in technically sound
condition and with sufficient hoisting capacity shall be used.
DANGER
For handling of plant components only the provided suspension points and marked
eyebolts shall be used.
Persons must not stay or work under suspended loads.
It is prohibited to transport persons together with the load or on the load
suspension devices.
ATTENTION IN CASE OF WORK IN ELEVATED POSITIONS!
Never use equipment parts for climbing.
When work in overhead positions is required, use only tested and approved
DANGER equipment for protection against falling down.
In case of repair or maintenance work in elevated positions the workforce may fall
down and suffer heavy injuries or even death.
Therefore, use only approved climbing aids and working platforms.
DANGER DUE TO BLOCKED ESCAPE ROUTES
DANGER Keep escape routes free from all obstacles: never put down or store components in
escape routes and observe the applicable safety rules.
Damage to the paint must be eliminated according to the paint specification after
having finished maintenance works.

1.2 Ropes and Rope Fixtures
 Ropes must be kept under supervision while they are in operation and while they are not used. This is
applicable not only to the ropes but also to the rope fixtures, rope connections and rope guides.
 In case of wire rope fixtures, the specified number of rope clips must not be reduced.

1.4 Repair
1.4.1 Basic Safety Notes
DANGER FOR THE STABILITY!
All repair work must be realized only at wind speeds up to maximum 5 m/s. During
the repairs, the wind speed must not exceed 10 m/s!
DANGER
DANGER DUE TO UNINTENDED RE-START!
Prior to repair, the conveying routes affected and upstream conveyors of machines
must be made empty. Suitable actions are required to ensure that such equipment
cannot be started by mistake.
DANGER Starting of the electrical or hydraulic drives of the assembly groups that are being
worked on, must be excluded.
DANGER FOR THE STABILITY!
In case repair work technology makes it necessary to erect piles between ground
level and machine, the load carrying capacity of soil must be calculated before the
piles are erected (the permitted ground pressure need to be complied).
The piles must be erected on a ground level sufficiently able to take the maximum
load.
The size of the piles must be selected according to the permitted ground pressure
DANGER and the imposed load.
The piles must be secured against overturning.
In this process need to be ensured that the piles are positioned vertically and
centrically under the support points.
DANGER FOR THE STABILITY!
In case of using mobile lifting devices, the load carrying capacity of soil must be
calculated before (the permitted ground pressure need to be complied).
DANGER
DANGER DUE TO OBJECTS FALLING DOWN!
For all repair works it is forbidden to stay under the repair area! This area has to be
closed off across a large area.
DANGER Falling objects may cause severe bodily injury or loss of life.

WARNING! RISK OF INJURIES CAUSED BY SPRING TENSION/CHAIN TENSION!
When installing or removing components under mechanical stresses, persons might
suffer injuries and equipment parts may become damaged or even destroyed.
Before performing work on such components suitable action should be taken to
DANGER exclude such potential risks.
RISK OF SQUEEZING-OFF LIMBS
The conveying belt is always under tension, even while a belt conveyor is switched
off. In the case of works where the conveyor belt exerts a direct or indirect effect,
pretension must be neutralized by relieving the conveyor belt before starting the
work. This might result in a short movement of the conveyor belt and the take-up
DANGER device.
RISK OF SQUEEZING-OFF LIMBS
For all belt-drive repair works suitable measures (e.g. belt clamps) have to be used
to secure the conveyor belt against self-actuated movement.
DANGER
DANGER DUE TO MISSING OR NOT CORECTLY INSTALLED SAFETY APPLIANCES
After repair all safety devices must be checked for mounting and function and a
start-up test without transported material must be realized!
DANGER
DANGER FOR THE STABILITY!
Repair works at
 Spherical bearings of the bridge segments
 Hoisting -and levelling cylinder
 Main carrying construction
As well as the disassebly of machine parts of the crawler drive notably affect the
DANGER stability of the entire plant. That is why these works may only be carried out after
having consulted the company FAM and only by qualified maintenance personnel.
Non-observance of this instruction may lead to damages at the plant, severe or even
fatal injuries.

In case of repair where fitting bolts or fitting bolt connections are to be removed,
the parts concerned shall be properly marked so that they can be re-installed in
the correct positions!
If the fitting bolt connections have been removed, in the course of reassembly
they should be replaced by new bolts with a thicker fitting shaft. Conjointly the
IMPORTANT holes should be bored to a larger size.

1.5.1 Replacement of Drive Unit
For documentation of the drive unit see Manual 7, Register 7.1.1.
NOTE
POTENTIAL HAZARDS CAUSED BY ELECTRIC POWER
POTENTIAL RISK OF AUTOMATIC OR UNINTENDED START OF MACHINE
Only qualified electricians should carry out work on the power supply system.
DANGER Make sure that machine and plant equipment subject to compulsory inspections,
repair and maintenance work are isolated from power before such work is carried
out. To be sure, check the isolated equipment items if they are still under voltage.
Earth and short-circuit them and isolate other equipment in the vicinity from power
supply.
DANGER
Prior to all repair and erection work, the equipment and its components should be
isolated from power supply so that drives cannot be started by mistake while repair
work is carried out.
All cable connections of components to be replaced must be disconnected. After
reassembly, cable connections must be made again!
Prior to repair work, run the Semi mobile crushing station empty and put it out of
operation.
Block the apron feeder, the adjacent spillage conveyor and the impact crusher in a
way preventing the machine from any undesired movements.
DANGER
Loosen the cover of
torque support
Loosen the shrink disk
