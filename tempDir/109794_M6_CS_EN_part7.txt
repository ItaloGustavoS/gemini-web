1.6.6 Tensioning the Chain
Prior to repair work, run the Semi mobile crushing station empty and put it out of
operation.
Block the spillage conveyor, the adjacent apron feeder and the impact crusher in a
way preventing the machine from any undesired movements.
DANGER
 Tensioning of the chain and releasing of the tension is performed via take-up nuts at the take-up spindles.
Tensioning and releasing of the tension must be carried out evenly on both
tensioning bearings in order to avoid jamming.
IMPORTANT
Take-up nuts Compression spring Take-up spindle
 After the lock nuts of the take-up spindle have been loosened, the take-up tumbler can be shifted by means
of the tensioning screw.
 The correct chain tension force is reached if the determined distance dimension between compression
spring and take-up frame is set (spring tension = 207 mm).
 Lock the lock nuts.
 Test operation of the equipment without conveyed material.

1.7.1 Replacement of Drive Unit
For documentation of the drive unit see Manual 7, Register 7.3.1.
NOTE
POTENTIAL HAZARDS CAUSED BY ELECTRIC POWER
POTENTIAL RISK OF AUTOMATIC OR UNINTENDED START OF MACHINE
Only qualified electricians should carry out work on the power supply system.
DANGER Make sure that machine and plant equipment subject to compulsory inspections,
repair and maintenance work are isolated from power before such work is carried
out. To be sure, check the isolated equipment items if they are still under voltage.
Earth and short-circuit them and isolate other equipment in the vicinity from power
supply.
DANGER
Prior to all repair and erection work, the equipment and its components should be
isolated from power supply so that drives cannot be started by mistake while repair
work is carried out.
All cable connections of components to be replaced must be disconnected. After
reassembly, cable connections must be made again!
Prior to repair work, run the Semi mobile crushing station empty and put it out of
operation.
Block the impact crusher, the adjacent apron feeder and the spillage conveyor in a
way preventing the machine from any undesired movements.

 Prior to disassembly, make sure that the drive unit is switched off and secured against unintended start-up.
 Remove all cable connections from the drive unit.
 Disassemble the motor (note the instructions of manufacturer!):
 Suspend the motor (approx. weight 6400 kg) on a suitable hoisting gear.
WARNING, DANGER OF SQUEEZING INJURIES
Utmost care is required when suspending or threading-in auxiliary tools for lifting
of loads (chains, lifting belts, ropes). Note the risk of squeezing-off limbs.
WARNING
 Detach the coupling so that the motor is free.
 Undo the fastening bolts to the supporting structure.
 Lift the drive unit and put it safely down on the ground.
CAUTION, SUSPENDED LOADS!
Persons are not permitted to stay or work under suspended loads. Every movement
must be continuously monitored by several persons. The operator and monitoring
personnel must always remain in contact.
DANGER
 Disassemble the coupling.
 Sling the coupling (weight 520 kg) to a suitable hoisting gear.
 Remove the coupling from the V-belt pulley shaft.
 Bring the components to the repair site for further disassembly.
 Re-assemble the unit in reversed order under observance of following instructions:
 Note the tightening torques.
 Restore all electrical connections.

1.7.2 Opening the Crusher Housing
For documentation of the hydraulic equipment see Manual 7, Register 7.3.3.
NOTE
The rear part of the housing may be hydraulically slewed back so that the interior
space of crusher can be inspected and the blow bars can be replaced. When the
rear part of the housing is slewed back, the distance between the flanges is about
NOTE
2039 mm.
Prior to repair work, run the Semi mobile crushing station empty and put it out of
operation.
Block the impact crusher, the adjacent apron feeder and the spillage conveyor in a
way preventing the machine from any undesired movements.
DANGER
 The impact crusher must be electrically interlocked in such a way that the drive motor cannot be started
when the rear part of housing is opened.
 Remove the fastening screws from the flanges between the fixed and moveable parts of the housing.
 Open the manual valve of hydraulic opening device so that the hydraulic cylinders can gradually fold back
the rear part of the housing. Use the safety bar for opening-up to secure the housing part in this position.
When operating the hydraulic equipment, make sure that all doors and flaps are
closed.
IMPORTANT
The machine should be opened, only granting the sight contact of the operator to
the crusher.

 After opening, use the rotor arresting bolt to secure the rotor (at the free shaft end).
 Closing of the housing rear part is performed in reversed order. Make sure that the housing flanges are
clean.
 Install the hexagon head bolts.
After every fifth opening operation the locking nuts must be replaced by new
items.
IMPORTANT
 Pull out the spring cotter so that the rotor arresting bolts can be removed and installed in their receptacle
provided therefore. The inspection door in the hood should be opened. After that, install the spring cotter in
the bore again.

1.7.3 Replacement of Blow Bars
Prior to repair work, run the Semi mobile crushing station empty and put it out of
operation.
Block the impact crusher, the adjacent apron feeder and the spillage conveyor in a
way preventing the machine from any undesired movements.
DANGER
When replacing single blow bars, note that the blow bar on the opposite side must
be replaced as well.
IMPORTANT
 Open the housing rear part (see Chapter 1.7.2)
 Rotate the rotor until the blow bar to be replaced reaches the angle of approx. 67,5 degrees relating to the
rotor (11 o´clock position).
 Switch off the drive unit and secure it against unintended start-up.
 Use the rotor securing pin (at the free shaft end) to arrest the rotor.

the pins on the left and right sides.
WARNING, DANGER OF SQUEEZING INJURIES
Utmost care is required when suspending or threading-in auxiliary tools for lifting
of loads (chains, lifting belts, ropes). Note the risk of squeezing-off limbs.
WARNING
 Remove the complete unit from the rotor and make sure that heavy oscillations are avoided.

next blow bar.
 Repeat this procedure until the desired number of blow bars has been replaced.
 Re-assemble the unit in reversed order under observance of following instructions:
When installing the balanced blow bars, it must be ensured that the opposite blow
bars have the same weight.
